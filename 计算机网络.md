## Computer Network & Network Reference Model

### Overview of Computer Network



### OSI Reference Model

### TCP/IP Model

### Network Topology

### Network Devices

network

A network is an  intricately connected system of objects, devices, or people.

Companies created networks

As companies expanded, the need for connecting networks at different sites became important 

### 广域网与局域网的区别

**Lan** local Area Networks

* Operate locally (cover small area)
* multi-user aceess
* high speeds expected (up to Gbps/10Gbps)
* Error rate is easily controlled

**WAN** wide Area Networks

* operate over lager areas
* access over serial links, optical links
* traditionally, have lower speeds
* error rate can not be easily controlled


**Protocol**

same language (same set of rules)

**Data Packets**

数据包

small, easily transmitted units

in OSI model, called packets, frames, segments;

**Source and Destination**

Source: the identity of the computer sending the packet

Destination: the identity of the computer designated to receive the packet

**Media Types**

传输介质

Media material through which data packets travel

**Digital Bandwidth** 带宽？

the measure of how much information can flow from one place to another in a given amount of time

bits/second (bps)

## OSI (Open System Interconnection) Model

a network model that help network builders implement networks that could communicate and work together

A **layered** communication process

* Each layer performs a specific task

| layerName    | function                         |
| ------------ | -------------------------------- |
| Application  | User interface                   |
| Presentation | Data presentation and encryption |
| Session      | Inter-host connection            |
| Transport    | End-to-end connections           |
| Network      | Addresses and best path          |
| Data Link    | Access to media                  |
| Physical     | Binary transmission              |

**application layers**

top three. deal with user interface, data formatting, and the application access

**data flow layers**

layers 1-4. control the physical delivery of messages over the network

### Layer 1 physical layer

signal and media

defines the electrical and functional specifications for the link between end systems

### Layer 2 the Data Link Layer 

keywords : frame, media access control

provides reliable transit of data

### layer 3 Network

keywords: **Path selection, Routing, Addressing**

provide connectivity and path selection between two end systems where routing occurs

### Layer 4: Transport

keywords: **Reliability, Flow control, Error correction**

responsible for reliable network communnication between end nodes and provides mechanisms for the establishment, maintenance, and termination of virtual circuits, transport fault detection and recovery, and information flow control.

### Layer 5: Session

keywords: Dialog(对话) and conversations

manages data exchange between presentation layer entities

### Layer 6: Presentation

keywords: Common  Format

concerned with data structures and negotiation of data transfer syntax

### Layer 7: Presentation

keyword: Browser

don't provide services to any other OSI layer

## TCP / IP Model

get through every time, under any conditions, from any one point to any other point.

Four layers

* Application
* Transport
* Internet
* Network Access

###Application Layer

Handles high-level protocols, issues of repersentation, encoding, and session control

### Transport Layer

deal with the quality of service issues of **reliablility, flow control, and error correction**



**TCP: Transmission Control Protocol**

**UDP: User Datagram(数据报) Protocol**

package application layer information into units called segments

#### Internet Layer

purpose: send packets and have them arrive **independent of  the path and networks**

Best path determination and packet switching occurs at this layer

**Internet protocol(IP)**

###Network Access Layer

host-to-network layer



名次解释

* FTP File Transfer Protocol
* HTTP Hypertext Transfer Protocol
* SMTP Simple Mail Transfer protocol
* DNS Domain Name System
* TFTP Trivial File Transfer Protocol

## Network Topology (拓扑)

### Topology

* defines the structure of the network
* physical topology and logical topology

#### Bus

Each host is wired to a common wire

#### Ring

all devices wired directly to each other in what is called a daisy-chain

#### Dual Ring （双的）

there is a second, redundant ring, that connects the same devices

reliable and flexible

#### star

a star topology has a central node with a central node with all links radiating from it

#### tree

uses a trunk(中继？) node frome which it branches to other nodes

hierarchical (分层的)



#### Complete(Mesh)

maximum connectivity and reliability

overwhelming

#### Cellular

wireless technology

receving nodes (phone) and sending nodes(satellite) may move

##Computer Devices

hosts- devices connected directly to network segment

* printers, computers, servers, FAX, copier

not part of any layer, but the functions of the OSI model are performed in software inside host



NICs Network Interface Card. 网络适配器

carries a unique code called a MAC address

used to control data communication for the host on the network

transceiver used to convert signals

provides the host's access to the medium



Media

carries a flow of information in bits



repeaters

extend the length of the network

regenerate and retime network signals at the bit level



Hubs

regenerate and retime network signals

propagate signals

cannot filter traffic

used as network concentration points



Repeaters/Hubs Differences

* repeaters has only two ports and a hub has 4-20+ ports
* repeaters receives on one port and repeaters on the other
* while hubs receive on one port and transmit on all other ports 



Bridges

* filter traffic on a LAN.
* keep track of MAC addresses that are on each side of the bridge and make decisions based on this MAC address list



Switches

concentrate connectivity

combine the connectivity of a hub with the traffic regulation of a bridge

switch frames from incoming ports to outgoing ports providing each port with full bandwidth

provide separate data paths



Routers 路由器

examine packets, choose the best path for them, and then switch them out the proper outgoing port.

two primary purposes: path selection and swithing of packets to best route



clouds

all devices that connect your computer to some very distant computer, perhaps on another continent

contain NICs, switches, bridges, routers, gateways, and other net-working devices



transceivers, repeaters, and hubs are all considered active Layer 1 devices because they act only on bits and require energy

patch cables, patch panels, and other interconnection components are considered passive Layer 1 components because they simply provides some sort of conducting path.

NICs are Layer 2 devices because they are the location of the MAC address; but because they often handling signaling and encoding, they are also 1 devices

Bridges and switches are Layer 2 devices because they use Layer 2 information to make decisions about whether to forward packets

Routers are Layer 3 devices because they use Layer 3 addresses to choose best paths and to switch packets to proper route



# OSI Layer 1: Physical Layer

## Type of Network

shared Media

* multiple hosts can access the same medium. share the same media

Point to point

* one device is connected to the other one via a link

## LAN Media

* to transmit data
* transmission process--encoding
* cable types STP, UTP, coaxial, fiber-optics

STP (Shielded Twisted Pair)

4-pair wiring combines shielding and cancellation via twisting of wires

150-Ohm

双绞线 

双绞：

每对线电流方向相反，磁场抵消

每条线一份数据，噪音一样，一份拷贝反转后可以通过比较滤除噪声。

affords greater protection against all type of external interference than UTP

Speed and throughput 10-100 Mbps

Maximum cable length : 100m (short)



ScTP (Screened Twisted Pair)

wrapped in a metallic foil shield or screen

Both STP and ScTP prevent incoming electromagnetic waves from causing noise on data wires and also minimizes outgoing radiated electromagnetic waves

expensive



disadvantages

* cannot run cable as far as some other types of networking media without signal being repeated
* insulation adds considerably to size, weight, and const of cable
* shielding materials make terminations more difficult and susceptible to poor workmanship



UTP Unshielded Twisted Pair

least Expensive 

100m

relies solely on the cancellation effect, produced by twisted wire pairs to limit signal degradation caused by EMI and RFI

**advantage**

* easy to install, less expensive
* cost less per meter
* small external diameter
* is installed using an RJ connector

**disadvantages**

* more *prone* to electrical noise and interference
* distance between signal boosts is shorter



coaxial 同轴电缆

inexpensive

medium 500m

* longer network, less expensive



Fiber-Optic 光纤 Optical 光学的视觉的 fiber 纤维

100+Mbps

Most Expensive

up to 3000m

* conducts modulated light transmission
* not susceptible to EMI or RFI and is capable of higher data rates than other networking media
* electromagetic waves are guided through optical fiber

Single Mode

* axial: light travels down the axial of the cable
* faster than multimode because of the dispersion in multimode
* typically used for WANS
* smaller in diameter than multimode
* uses ILD most often but also LED

MultiMode

* light enters the glass pipe at different angles and travels nonaxially, which means it bounces back and forth off the walls of the glass tube.
* larger than single mode, used most often in LANS
* susceptible to greater dispersion
