## Computer Network & Network Reference Model

### Overview of Computer Network



### OSI Reference Model

### TCP/IP Model

### Network Topology

### Network Devices

network

A network is an  intricately connected system of objects, devices, or people.

Companies created networks

As companies expanded, the need for connecting networks at different sites became important 

### 广域网与局域网的区别

**Lan** local Area Networks

* Operate locally (cover small area)
* multi-user aceess
* high speeds expected (up to Gbps/10Gbps)
* Error rate is easily controlled

**WAN** wide Area Networks

* operate over lager areas
* access over serial links, optical links
* traditionally, have lower speeds
* error rate can not be easily controlled


**Protocol**

same language (same set of rules)

**Data Packets**

数据包

small, easily transmitted units

in OSI model, called packets, frames, segments;

**Source and Destination**

Source: the identity of the computer sending the packet

Destination: the identity of the computer designated to receive the packet

**Media Types**

传输介质

Media material through which data packets travel

**Digital Bandwidth** 带宽？

the measure of how much information can flow from one place to another in a given amount of time

bits/second (bps)

## OSI (Open System Interconnection) Model

a network model that help network builders implement networks that could communicate and work together

A **layered** communication process

* Each layer performs a specific task

| layerName    | function                         |
| ------------ | -------------------------------- |
| Application  | User interface                   |
| Presentation | Data presentation and encryption |
| Session      | Inter-host connection            |
| Transport    | End-to-end connections           |
| Network      | Addresses and best path          |
| Data Link    | Access to media                  |
| Physical     | Binary transmission              |

**application layers**

**data flow layers**

layers 1-4. control the physical delivery of messages over the network

### Layer 1 physical layer

signal and media

defines the electrical and functional specifications for the link between end systems

### Layer 2 the Data Link Layer 

keywords : frame, media access control

provides reliable transit of data

### layer 3 Network

#### Internet Layer

purpose: send packets and have them arrive **independent of  the path and networks**

Best path determination and packet switching occurs at this layer

**Internet protocol(IP)**

###Network Access Layer

host-to-network layer



名次解释

* FTP File Transfer Protocol
* HTTP Hypertext Transfer Protocol
* SMTP Simple Mail Transfer protocol
* DNS Domain Name System

## Network Topology (拓扑)

### Topology

* defines the structure of the network
* physical topology and logical topology

#### Bus

Each host is wired to a common wire

#### Ring

all devices wired directly to each other in what is called a daisy-chain

#### Dual Ring （双的）

there is a second, redundant ring, that connects the same devices

reliable and flexible

#### star

a star topology has a central node with a central node with all links radiating from it

#### tree

uses a trunk(中继？) node frome which it branches to other nodes

hierarchical (分层的)



#### Complete(Mesh)

maximum connectivity and reliability

overwhelming

#### Cellular

wireless technology

receving nodes (phone) and sending nodes(satellite) may move

##Computer Devices

hosts- devices connected directly to network segment

* printers, computers, servers, FAX, copier

not part of any layer, but the functions of the OSI model are performed in software inside host



NICs Network Interface Card. 网络适配器

carries a unique code called a MAC address

used to control data communication for the host on the network

transceiver used to convert signals

provides the host's access to the medium



Media

carries a flow of information in bits



repeaters

extend the length of the network

regenerate and retime network signals at the bit level



Hubs

regenerate and retime network signals

propagate signals

cannot filter traffic

used as network concentration points



Repeaters/Hubs Differences

* repeaters has only two ports and a hub has 4-20+ ports
* repeaters receives on one port and repeaters on the other
* while hubs receive on one port and transmit on all other ports 



Bridges

* filter traffic on a LAN.
* keep track of MAC addresses that are on each side of the bridge and make decisions based on this MAC address list



Switches

concentrate connectivity

combine the connectivity of a hub with the traffic regulation of a bridge

switch frames from incoming ports to outgoing ports providing each port with full bandwidth

provide separate data paths



Routers 路由器

examine packets, choose the best path for them, and then switch them out the proper outgoing port.

two primary purposes: path selection and swithing of packets to best route



clouds

all devices that connect your computer to some very distant computer, perhaps on another continent

contain NICs, switches, bridges, routers, gateways, and other net-working devices



transceivers, repeaters, and hubs are all considered active Layer 1 devices because they act only on bits and require energy

patch cables, patch panels, and other interconnection components are considered passive Layer 1 components because they simply provides some sort of conducting path.

NICs are Layer 2 devices because they are the location of the MAC address; but because they often handling signaling and encoding, they are also 1 devices

Bridges and switches are Layer 2 devices because they use Layer 2 information to make decisions about whether to forward packets

Routers are Layer 3 devices because they use Layer 3 addresses to choose best paths and to switch packets to proper route



# OSI Layer 1: Physical Layer

## Type of Network

shared Media

* multiple hosts can access the same medium. share the same media

Point to point

* one device is connected to the other one via a link

## LAN Media

* to transmit data
* transmission process--encoding
* cable types STP, UTP, coaxial, fiber-optics

STP (Shielded Twisted Pair)

4-pair wiring combines shielding and cancellation via twisting of wires

150-Ohm

双绞线 

双绞：

每对线电流方向相反，磁场抵消

每条线一份数据，噪音一样，一份拷贝反转后可以通过比较滤除噪声。

affords greater protection against all type of external interference than UTP

Speed and throughput 10-100 Mbps

Maximum cable length : 100m (short)



ScTP (Screened Twisted Pair)

wrapped in a metallic foil shield or screen

Both STP and ScTP prevent incoming electromagnetic waves from causing noise on data wires and also minimizes outgoing radiated electromagnetic waves

expensive



disadvantages

* cannot run cable as far as some other types of networking media without signal being repeated
* insulation adds considerably to size, weight, and const of cable
* shielding materials make terminations more difficult and susceptible to poor workmanship



UTP Unshielded Twisted Pair

least Expensive 

100m

relies solely on the cancellation effect, produced by twisted wire pairs to limit signal degradation caused by EMI and RFI

**advantage**

* easy to install, less expensive
* cost less per meter
* small external diameter
* is installed using an RJ connector

**disadvantages**

* more *prone* to electrical noise and interference
* distance between signal boosts is shorter



coaxial 同轴电缆

inexpensive

medium 500m

* longer network, less expensive



Fiber-Optic 光纤 Optical 光学的视觉的 fiber 纤维

100+Mbps

Most Expensive

up to 3000m

* conducts modulated light transmission
* not susceptible to EMI or RFI and is capable of higher data rates than other networking media
* electromagetic waves are guided through optical fiber

Single Mode

* axial: light travels down the axial of the cable
* faster than multimode because of the dispersion in multimode
* typically used for WANS
* smaller in diameter than multimode
* uses ILD most often but also LED

MultiMode

* light enters the glass pipe at different angles and travels nonaxially, which means it bounces back and forth off the walls of the glass tube.
* larger than single mode, used most often in LANS
* susceptible to greater dispersion




Wireless Communication

The primary way of distinguishing between different electromagnetic waves is by their frequency.



Wireless Transmission Methods

* Lasers(激光）.  output a coherent（连贯一致） electromagnetic field in which all waves are at the same frequency and are aligned in a phase
* Infrared(红外线). normally a line-of-sight technology but can be bounced or redirected. cannot go through opaque objects
* Radio(无线电). carry data signals that can pass through walls. both terrestrial and satellite radio technologies

1. travel time.

* Attenuation 稀释 减少

1. loss of signal over distance due to surroundings
2.  can affect a network

* Reflection

1.  the result of *impedance mismatch* is reflected energy

* Noise

1. Crosstalk- electrical noise from other wires in a cable
2. EMI (electromagnetic interference) can  be caused by electric motors
3. Cancellation of signals can be avoided through the twisting of wire pairs to provide self-shielding within the network media.



* Timing problem

1. Latency-- delay of network signal



* Collisions and Collision Domains 碰撞
  1.  a collision occurs when two bits propagate at the same time on the same network
  2. Collision domains are extended by adding repeaters and hubs
  3. Networks can be segmented by adding intelligent devices such as bridges, switches, and routers
  4. A *late collision* is when a collision happens after the first bytes of the frame are transmitted
  5. These late collision frames add delay referred to as *consumption delay*



* 5 - 4 - 3 -2 - 1 Rule 4 Repeater Rule

Five sections of the network, four repeaters or hubs, three sections of the network are "mixing" sections (with hosts), two sections are link sections (for link purposes), and one large collision domain

* 缺点
  * 难以分辨一位的开始与一位的结束
  * 发送方和接收方必须有时钟同步
  * 若信号量“0”或“1”连续出现，信号直流分量将增加，单极性编码的直流分量问题严重。
  * 易产生错误



极化编码 不归零制码 NRZ Non-Return to Zero

原理： 负电平表示”0“，正电平表示”1“

缺点：

* 发送方与接收方必须时钟同步
* 若 0 1 连续出现，信号直流分量仍将累加



不归零制码 NRZ Non-Return to Zero

不归零反向编码

* 原理 信号电平的一次翻转代表比特1， 无电平变化代表0
* 不归零反相编码优于不归零电平编码。 每次遇到零都会跃迁，因此根据电平跃迁可以进行有限的同步



归零制码 RZ Return to Zero

原理： 负电平表示 0 ，正电平表示1。 比特中位跳变到零电平，从而提供同步。

优点： 信号本身带有同步信息，经济性好，且不易出错。

缺点： 采用三个不同电平，两次信号变化编码1比特，增加了占用的带宽



极化编码：

原理，每一位中间都有一个跳变，从低到高表示 0 ，从高到低表示 1

优点： 克服了NRZ码的不足。每位中间的跳变，既可以作为数据，又可以作为时钟，能够自同步，只采用两个电平，跳变减少，比RZ码效率高



差分曼彻斯特码 Differential Manchester

原理：

#OSI Layer 2: Data Link Layer

## Overview of the Data Link Layer

Data Link Layer

Node: Host and router in the network

Link : The channel connects the adjacent nodes

Node -> frame -> frame -> Node



DATA LINK LAYER provides:

* Access to networking media
* Physical transmission across the media

Layer 2 protocols(procedures) define:

* the format of data exchanged on a link
* the action of two nodes on the link

'procedure' = 'protocol' there



LANS and the Data Link Layer

* Main tasks:
  * error notification
  * network topology
  * flow control
* differences between 1 and 2
  * Layer 1 cannot communicate with the upper-level layers; layer 2 does with *Logical Link Control(LLC)*
  * 1 cannot decide which host will transmit or receive binary data from a group; 2 does that with *Media Access Control(MAC)*
  * 1 cannot name or identify computers; 2 uses an *addressing (or naming) process*
  * 1 can only describe streams of bits; 2 uses *frame* to organize or group the bits



Services provided

* connectionless service with no acknowledgement, used on:
  * reliable links
  * real-time tasks
  * Most of LANs
* Connectionless service with acknowledgements: unreliable link, such as the wireless network
* connection service with acknowledge



Media Access Control in Common LANs

* **Ethernet** logical bus topology(information flow is on a linear bus) and physical star or extended star(wired as a star)
* **Token Ring** logical ring topology(information flow is in a ring) and a physical star topology (wired as a star)
* **FDDI** logical ring topology and physical dual ring



Two broad categories:

* *Deterministic*(确定性的) taking turns

  * Token Ring and FDDI

* *Non-deterinistic(probabilistic)* first come, first served

* ​




Deterministic MAC Protocois

* a special data token circulates the ring
* when a host receives the token, it can transmit data instead of the token. This is called *seizing the token*
* when the transmitted frame comes back around to the transmitter, the station transmits a new token; the frame is removed or *stripped from the ring*



Non-Deterministic MAC Protocols

* the MAC protocol is called **Carrier Sense Multiple Access with Collision Detection(CSMA/CD)**\
* ethernet allows the networking devices to arbitrate for the right to transmit to use this shared-medium technology



LAN Transmission Methods

* **unicast** a single packet is sent from the source to a single destination on a network
* **multicast** consists of a single data packet that is sent to a specific subset of nodes on the network
* **broadcast** consists of a single data packet that is transmitted to all nodes on the network

##Ethernet and CSMA/CD



**LAN Standards**

* Define **the physical media** and **the connectors** used to connect devices to media
* Define **the way devices communicate at the DATA LINK LAYER**
* The DATA LINK LAYER defines **how data is transported** over a physical media
* The DATA LINK LAYER also defines **how to encapsulate protocol-specific traffic**
* The DATA LINK LAYER also defines **how to encapsulate protocol-specific traffic** in such a way that traffic going to different upper-layer protocols can use the same *channel* as it goes up the stack

 Data link layer is broken into two parts by IEEE:

Media Access Control(MAC) transitions down to media

Logical Link Control (LLC) transitions up to the network layer



IEEE standard:

* First, it defines its own layer(LLC), including its interfaces, etc.
* Second, it appears that the MAC layer standards, 802.3 and 802.5, cross over the Layer 2/Layer 1 interface

However, 802.3 and 802.5 define the naming, framing, and Media Access Control rules around which specific technologies were built.



MAC sublayer（802.3)

* defines how to **transmit frames** on the physical wire 
* Handles physical addressing
* Define network topology
* Define line discipline



LLC sublayer(802.2)

* **logically identifies different protocol types** and then **encapsulates** them
* Use SAP identifier to perform the logical identification
* The type of LLC frame depends on what identifier the upper layer protocol expects




Media Access Control Sublayer

|       | Preamble | Dest. add. | Source add. | Length | Data     | FCS  |
| ----- | -------- | ---------- | ----------- | ------ | -------- | ---- |
| bytes | 8        | 6          | 6           | 2      | Variable | 4    |

Dest.add.         0000.0C(IEEE assigned)|XX.XXXX (Vendor assigned)\



Begin with an alternating pattern of 1s and 0s called a **preamble**(10101011)

The **preamble** tells receiving stations that a frame is coming



**Destination** and **Source physical address**

* source address: always a unicast address
* destination address: unicast,multicast,or broadcast



**length** 

indicates the number of bytes of data that follow this field and precede frame check sequence field



**data**

contains the information you want to send



**FCS** four bytes 循环冗余检查

contains a **cyclic redundancy check**

* the sending device creates the CRC
* the receiving device recalculates the CRC to check for damage that might have occurred to the frame in transit



LLC  Logical Link Control sublayer manages communication between devices over a single link. supports both **connectionless** and **connect-oriented services**. allows part of the **Data Link Layer** to function independently from existing technologies. can be compatibe with different MAC sub-layers



LLC  Encapsulation



network -> LLC -> MAC -> Physical layer  Position of LLC

packet -> LLC | Packet ->  MAC|LLC|Packet|MAC -> Media Encapsulation



**Encapsulation**

LLC takes the network protocol data(packet), add more control information

* add two addressing components of the 802.2 specification to identify the upper layer protocol at each end:
  * The Destination Service Access Point(DSAP)
  * The Source Service Access Point(SSAP)
* repackaged data then travels to MAC for further encapsulation of the data



### Media Access Control in  MAC Sub-layer



Hexadecimal Numbers as MAC addresses

* 48 bits. expressed as 12 hexadecimal digits
* first 6 digits (left to right), which the IEEE administers, identify the **manufacturer** or **vendor** and comprise the **Organizational Unique Identifier(OUI**
* remaing 6 digits comprise the interface serial number, administered by specific vendor



Ethernet 802.3 Broadcast

* Broadcast
  * the destination MAC : all 1s(FFFF.FFFF.FFFF)
* Broadcasting **seriously** **affect the performance** of stations by interrupting them unnecessarily
* broadcasts used only when
  * The MAC address of the destination is unknown
  * the destination is all hosts



Framing

* Framing is the Layer 2 encapsulation process
* A frame is a layer 2 protocol data unit(PDU)
* A frame has sections called *fields*, and each field is composed of bytes

Field Names

| A           | B             | C                 | D         | E         | F          |
| ----------- | ------------- | ----------------- | --------- | --------- | ---------- |
| Start Frame | Address Field | Type/Length Field | DataField | FCS Field | Stop Frame |



Ethenet Media Access Control -- CSMA/CD: History

Carrier Sense Multiple Access with Collision Detection

带冲突检测的载波监听多路访问技术

* CSMA/CD stems form ALOHA\
* Ethernet/IEEE 802.3 MAC mechanism: CSMA/CD
* Prue ALOHA:
  * hosts always can send the data **if they want**
  * if the signals collided, back off appropriate amount of time and resend
* Slotted ALOHA:
  * Hosts always can send data **if they want, but they must wait for a new slot**



Question: why don't we listen to the channel first to make sure that the channel is free?

This is CSMA . Carrier Sense Multiple Access



* 1-persist CSMA:
  * Hosts always can send the data(have the probability of 1) **if they find the channel is free; if the channel is busy, they will listen to the channel and wait**
    *  if the signals collided, back off appropriate amount of time and resend
* non-presist CSMA
  * Hosts always can send the data(have the probability of 1) **if they find the channel is free. if the channel is busy, they will wait for a while to listen to the channel again**
* p-persist CSMA：（Working on slotted channel):
  * if the hosts **find the channel is free, they will send the data in this slot at a probability of p, or propone the sending operation to the next slot at a probability of 1-p; if the channel is busy, they will wait  until the next slot**



CSMA/CD (Carrier Sense Multiple Accesss)

Anotherimprovement of ALOHA: Listen to the channel while transmitting data. If a
collision detected, all transmissions will be cancelled **at once**

* Use CSMA mechanism to judge if the host should send the data
* In the transmitting process, listen to the channel  at the same time
  * When a collision detected, broadcast the jam signal
  * Back off algorithms determine when the colliding stations can retransit



Ethernet Operation

* Ethernet is broadcast network. each station can see all the frames, regardless of whether they are destination
* whether a station is destination is judged by MAC address
* Destination station sends data up OSI layers. other  nodes discard frame





1. Listen then transmit
2. Broadcast jam signal 
3. Collision occurs
4. Devices back off appropriate amount of time and then retransmit



## Wireless LAN and CSMA/CA

* Wireless LAN
  * Communications based on cells
  * The signals sent by a station can only be received by the stations nearby
  * Short-Distance transmission
* Wireless LAN Standard
  * IEEE 802.11 不做要求
  * IEEE 802.11b
    * alsocalled Wi-Fi
    * increase transmission capabilities to 11 Mbps
  * IEEE 802.11a
    * Covers WLAN devices operating in the 5GHz transmission band
    * Using the 5GHz
  * IEEE 802.11g
  * IEEE 802.11n

Topology

* Infrastructure(基础设施) mode and ad-hoc  mode



Infrastructure Mode

* A Basic Service Set(BSS) includes a Base  Station(BS) and Several wireless hosts
  * All hosts can communicate with each other directly in local BSS
* Access Point(AP) acts as a BaseStation for infrastructure mode
  * AP is hard wired to the cabled LAN to provide Internet access and connectivity to the wired network
  * When an AP is installed, a Service Set Identifier(SSID) and a channel are assigned
* A BSS can connect to another BSS via a Distribution System(DS) and constructs an Extended Service Set(ESS)



Accessing Procedure

* when a client is activated within the WLAN
  * it will start "listening" for a compatible device with which to "associate"
* This is referred to as "scanning"
  * Active scanning
    * cause a probe request to be sent from the wireless node seeking to join the network
    * The probe request will contian the Service Set Identifier(SSID) of the network it wished to join
    * when an AP with same SSID is found, the AP will issue a probe response
    * the authentication and association steps are completed
  * passive scanning
    *  listen for beacon management frames(beacons), which are transmited by AP(infrastructure mode) or peer nodes(ad hocs)
    * when a node receives a beacon that contains the SSID of the network it is trying to join, an attempt is made to join the network
    * Passive scanning is a continuous process and nodes may associate or disassociate with APs as signal strength



frames in WLAN

* do **not** use a standard 802.3 frame
* there types of frame
  * Control Frames
  * Management frames
  * Data frames(Only data frames are similar to 802.3 frames)
* The payload of wireless data frames and 802,3 frames is 1500 bytes
  *  an Ether frame may not exceed 1518 bytes wheras could be 2346 bytes
  * usually the WLAN frame size will be limited to 1518 bytes as is most commonly connected to a wired Ethernet network

站点A->B 发送数据帧 数据帧必须经过AP转发



why need CSMA/CA

* Collisions can occur in WLAN, but the stations can only know the transmission nearby, so CSMA/CD is not a good choice

  * **Hidden Station Problem**

    * when A is transmitting data to B,C can't detect the  transmission between A and B, so perhaps C will decide to transmit data to B and result in a collision at B

  * **Exposed Station Proble**

    * when B is transmitting data to A, C can detect transmission, so C will not transmit data to D. But that is a mistake

      ​

      ​


Multiple Access Mechanism

* Ethernet
  * signals is transmitted to all stations on the cable
  * sending station detects the collisions
  * at a time, only an effective frame can be transmitted on the channel
* WLAN
  * signals is transmitted to stations near to the sending station on the cable
  * the MAC protocol must try it best to ensure only a sending station near to the receiving station
  * The receiving station detects the collisions
  * At a time, multiple effective frames can be transmitted on the  channel



CSMA/CA

* Carrier Sense Multiple Access with Collision Avoidance
  * 发送站点在发送数据时，以控制短帧刺激接收站点发送应答短帧，使接收站点周围的站点监听到该帧，从而在一定时间内避免数据发送
  * 基本过程
    * A send RTS帧 to B (Request To Send)，A周围的站点在一定时间内不发送数据，以保证CTS返回给A;
    * B向A回答（Clear To Send)CTS 帧， B周围的站点在一定时间内不发送数据，以保证A发送完数据
    * A开始发送
    * 若RTS或者CTS发送冲突，采用二进制指数后退算法等待随机时间，再重新开始



The Actual Throughput

* when a source node sends a frame, the receiving node returns a positive acknowledgement(ACK)
  * This can cause consumption of 50% of the available bandwidth
  * this reduces the actual data throughput to a aximum of 5.0 to 5.5 Mbps on an 802.11b wireless LAN rated at 11Mbps
* Performance of the network will also be affected by signal strength
  * As the signal becomes weaker, Adaptive Rate Selection(ARS) may be invoked
  * The transmitting unit will drop the data rate from 11Mbps to 5.5Mbps, form 5.5Mbps to 2Mbps or 2Mbps to 1Mbps



## Layer 2 Devices

NICs

* NICs perform important Layer 2 data link layer functions:
  * Logical Link Control communicates with upper layers in the computer
  * Media Access Control provides structure access to shared access media
  * naming :provides a unique MAC address identifier
  * framing: part of encapsulation process, packaging the bits for transport
  * signaling: creates signals and interface with the media by using built-in transceivers



Bridges

* Bridges divide traffic into segments and filters traffic based on the MAC address, **not based on protocols**

* Bridges can improve network performance by **reducing large collision domains**

* Bridges work best where traffic is low from one segment of a network to other segments

  * **when traffic between network segments becomes heavy, bridges can become a bottleneck and slow down communication**

* Transparent Bridge

  * 透明是指 局域网网上的站点不知道发送的帧经过哪几个网桥
  * 使用最多

* Source routing Bridge

  * 源路由（source route)网桥在发送帧时将详细的路由信息放在帧的首部

# OSI Layer 3 Network Layer



Routing and Addressing



Layer 3 Responsibilities

* Move data through networks
* Use a **hierarchical** addressing scheme (opposed to MAC addressing, which is flat)
* Segment network and control flow of traffic
* Reduce congestion
* Talk to other networks



Routers

* Interconnect network segments or networks
* make logical decisions based on ip addresses
* determine best path
* switch packets from incoming ports to outgoing ports

## IP addresses and Subnets

IP addresses. 32 bits

represented as four octets in dotted decimal format

133.14.17.0

two components

* network ID
  * assigned by ARIN(American Registry for Internet Numbers)
  * **identifies the network which a device is attached**
  * may be identified by one, two, or three of the first three octets
* host ID
  * assigned by a network administrator
  * identifies the specific device on that network
  * may be identified by one, two, or three of the last three octets

Class  A address0-127

Class B address 128-191

Class C address192-223

Class D 224-239 Multicast

Class E 240-255 Research

* the first address in each network is reserved for the network address
* the last address is reserved for the broadcast address



#### Reserved Addresses

* Network address
  * host部分以0结尾的ip地址
* class A例子： 113.0.0.0
* hosts on a network can  only communicate directly with other hosts if they have same network ID



Broadcast Address

* used to send data to all of the devices on a network
* Broadcast IP addresses end with binary 1s in host part of the address
  * example 176.10.255.255

#### private address space

10.0.0.0 - 10.255.255.255

172.16.0.0 - 172.31.255.255

192.168.0.0 - 192.168.255.255

there are certain IP address ranges

IP address depletion 枯竭 and solutions

* NAT
* CIDR
* IPv6



## Subnet

network administrators sometimes need to divide networks into smaller networks, called **subnets**, in order to provide extra flexibility

* bits are borrowed from the host field and are designated as the subnet field



**Basics**

* subnets are smaller divisions of networks
  * provide addressing flexibility
* subnet addresses are assigned locally by network administrator
* reduce a broadcast domain



#### how many bits can I borrow

minimum bits is two

|         | size of host | maximum |
| ------- | ------------ | ------- |
| classA  | 24           | 22      |
| Class B | 16           | 14      |
| Class C | 8            | 6       |
|         |              |         |



minimum bits are two, why?

if 1 bit,only have a netwrok number and a broadcast number



Byproduct: 副作用 waste addresses



subnet mask

* alias : extended network prefix
* define how many bits we use to construct the network, and how many bits to describe the host addresses



1. change the ip host address to binary
2. change the subnet mask to binary
3. use the boolean operator AND to combine the two
4. convert the network binary address to dotted decimal
